This repository, as a part of my application to Google Summer of Code program with Aerospaceresearch.net, aims to calculate the exact center of satellite signals in the frequency domain.

## After getting accepted to Google Summer of Code, my repository has been officially moved to https://github.com/aerospaceresearch/findsatbyrf/
