Currently this repository aims to calculate the exact center of signals from NOAA satellites.

In the "plots" folder, files with prefix "SDRSharp" are screenshots from SDRSharp showing the signal. Files with prefix "Python" are the signals reconstructed in Python.

The plots I have drawn has a vertical red line showing the centroid of signals between 0.4 and 0.5 MHz from 0 to 5 seconds.
